        <p>Perhaps one of the most influential creations in the past century, the website has a massive footprint in the modern landscape of the world.<br><br>This is what drew me towards diving into professional web design, the same way that Mark Zuckerberg changed the world with Facebook or Elon Musk with PayPal; our ideas have the potential to disrupt the flow as we know it.<br><br>I began developing my websites with Wix back in 2020 and ended up on Webflow as of recent.  These platforms lower the bar for those looking to dabble into Web Development.  Rather than requiring years of practice learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, you can start building a functional website today.<br><br>This allowed me to start a website for my own business and build sites for others in my network and help them digitize their ideas.</p>
