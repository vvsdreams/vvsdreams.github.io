        <p>Time, the measure of continuity of our existence: the past, the present, and the future.<br><br>As a photographer, every photo that I have taken becomes documentation for a moment in the past.  Halting continuity, the shutter has astronomical power where even the most mundane photo can mean everything to someone.<br><br>When you press that shutter button, you capture the present.  You capture a moment in time that may very well one day have great significance to someone.  This is what initially drew me to photography, the impact your images can have even if it is localized within your family or even just one person; It feels amazing to know your creativity can have that power.<br><br>My first camera was the Sony a6000, I remember feeling shaky spending that amount of money on a camera.  I was in <b>Beaufort, SC</b> at the time visiting my girlfriend and decided that now was the time to make the purchase.  When we returned to her dorm with the camera I started messing around taking shots of everything I could find.  I wasn't very satisfied at first, the shots were not coming great, in-fact many of them looked horrible.  Frustrated, I put the camera down and went to dinner.  We went to a local favorite "Dos Amigos," absolutely amazing!  When we returned from our excellent meal, I grabbed the camera.  Inspired to try again, I went out on her balcony and started taking pictures.  With each press of the shutter I was losing hope, and then it clicked; I finally got the shot I was looking for.  I was aiming to get an image of the car lights trailing and the result I got was stunning to me.  From this point on I was obsessed.<br><br>Moving from this day, I began to try to do this work professionally.  I ended up meeting so many amazing people that I would have never met going down this path.  I was working with musicians and when I tell you these are some of the most passionate people you will ever meet, I mean it.  I could tell when I met someone serious, you could almost see it in their eyes and this would inspire me to take my work to the next level and exceed what they were expecting.  I loved many aspects of this period of my life, but I ended up burning out trying to make it my main source of income.  This industry is certainly a labor of love and I still take projects from time to time, but I want this to be a passion and programming to be more in-line with my career ambitions.  </p>
