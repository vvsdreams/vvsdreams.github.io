        <p>Since my childhood, I've always felt some degree of wonderment towards computing.  Watching as capacitors encapsulated the world as I knew it and inconvenience becoming a thing of the past.<br><br>My interest began in programming spawned after learning how to build a computer, I wanted the computer to learn how to <u>work for me</u>.  So I embarked on this journey of teaching myself how to program at the age of 14; I decided that <b>C++</b> was the language I should learn...  Needless to say this interest was short-lived and I went back to playing League of Legends.<br><br>Years of my life passed and interests came and went along the way.  Late 2022 I began to feel the pains of comfortability, I felt as if everything I was doing wasn't challenging me in a fulfilling way.  A friend of mine had been showing me the programming work he was doing in college, and it began to re-kindle that interest of developing software.  I messed with Python a little here and there to build social media automation tools, but they were API derived, I didn't feel fully satisfied because it wasn't entirely my creation.  I decided that front-end development would be my entry point into this new world.<br><br>This year, getting into the Udacity program certainly motivated me to actually open my IDE and code.  I have watched tons of video on CS theory and how to code certain things, but I always felt this hesitation to open the IDE and actually try it.  Leading up to acceptance in the front-end development program, I practiced the FreeCodeCamp HTML course and became somewhat proficient.  This is where I am at now and this website is currently a testament to the world I have put in, whether it's impressive or not is up for you to decide.    </p>
